to do list:
  -   backpropagation!


values we need to find derivative of cost with respect to a certain weight:
  -   activation of previous connection
  -   unnormalized output of node
  -   Case 1: the next layer is a hidden layer
      -   weights connecting that node to next layers
          -   iterate over this
      -   unnormalized output of those nodes
  -   Case 2: the next layer is the output layer
      -  final output (normalized)
      -  desired output at node
